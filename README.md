## Description

This project implements a basic login system in C#. The system requires the user to input a username and password. It gives the user three attempts to log in successfully. After three failed attempts, the program exits. The default credentials are:

- Username: `1`
- Password: `1`

The program demonstrates how to handle user input and limit the number of login attempts using a simple loop and conditional statements.
